# 4.3.1 自顶向下表解析

For recognition we are only interested in one element in one entry of the table T: does TS,1 contain n, where S is the start symbol and n is the length of the input? To

![]()

find this out, we stack this query in some form on a stack and, using all grammar rules for S, we draw up a list of possibilities for TS,1 to contain n, much as we did in the Unger parser. For a rule like S--->AB these include:

- does TA,1 contain 0 and does TB,1 contain n?

- does TA,1 contain 1 and does TB,2 contain n−1?

- does TA,1 contain 2 and does TB,3 contain n−2?

- · · ·

- does TA,1 contain n and does TB,n+1 contain 0?

If the conditions in any of these lines are fulfilled, TS,1 must be made to contain n.

Each of these new queries can be expanded and examined in this same way. In the end the queries will develop into “terminal queries”, queries that can be resolved without creating new queries. Examples are “does Ta,k contain 1?”, which can be answered by checking if the input contains an a in position k, and “does TP,k contain 0”, which is equivalent to “does P produce ε?”. Once we have obtained an answer to a query we store it in the proper position in the table, and we do this not only for the top query, but also for all intermediate, generated queries. This is very important since now we can obtain the answer without further computation if the same query turns up again, which it frequently does. Note that this requires the possibility to store negative information (actually positive information about absence) in the entries of table T: an entry like TA,k can contain information like “does not contain 7”. Also note that this process does not always compute all entries in the table; it may miss entries that, given the grammar, can never be part of a recognition. For some applications this is an advantage.

The technique of storing results of computations in a table in order to replace recomputation by table lookup is called memoization (this is not a spelling error; there is really no ‘r’ in the word). It is a very useful and widely applicable device in algorithmics, and can often reduce the time requirements of an algorithm from exponential to polynomial, as it does in the present example. Memoization was invented in 1968 by Michie [410] and introduced in parsing by Sheil [20], who did not yet use the term “memoization”; see also Norvig [343].

Furthermore we have to concern ourselves with left-recursive non-terminals, again using the same technique as in the Unger parser. If the non-terminal A is leftrecursive, the query “does TA,1 contain n” will eventually again create the query “does TA,1 contain n”, and will thus start an endless loop. The loop can easily be prevented by just discarding this recursive occurrence of the same query, since a second computation would not bring in any information not already obtained by the first. Whether a generated query is a recursive occurrence can be determined by looking it up in the stack of queries. In short, top-down tabular parsing is very similar to Unger parsing with memoization.

A full implementation of this algorithm is discussed in Section 17.3.
