The top-down recognizer follows the grammar of regular expressions, which we summarize here:

![图1](../../img/5.8.1_1.png)

The recognizer keeps two pointers, one in the regular expression and one in the input, and tries to move both in unison: when a token is matched both pointers move one position forward, but when a simple_re must be repeated, the regular expression pointer jumps backwards, and the input pointer stays in place. When the regular expression pointer points to the end of the regular expression, the recognizer registers a match, based on how far the input pointer got.

When the recognizer tries to recognize a compound_re, it first finds out whether it is a repeat_re. If so, it checks the mark. If that is a + indicating a mandatory simple_re, the recognizer just continues searching for a simple_re, but if the simple_re is optional (*, ?), the search splits in two: one for a simple_re, and one for the rest of the regular expression, after this repeat_re. When the recognizer comes to the end of a repeat_re, it again checks the mark. If it is a ?, it just continues, but if it was a real repeater (*, +), the search again splits in two: one jumping back to the beginning of the repeat_re, and one continuing with the rest of the regular expression.

When the recognizer finds that the simple_re is a token, it compares the token with the token at the input pointer. If they match, both pointers are advanced; otherwise this search is abandoned.

Two questions remain: how do we implement the splitting of searches, and what do we do with the recorded matches. We implement the search splitting by doing them sequentially: we first do the entire first search up to the end or failure, includ- ing all its subsearches; then, regardless of the result, we do the second search. This sounds bothersome, both in coding and in efficiency, but it isn’t. The skeleton code for the optional repeat_re is just

where rp and ip are the regular expression pointer and the input pointer. And the al- gorithm is usually quite efficient, since almost all searches fail immediately because a token search compares two non-matching tokens.

The processing of the recorded matches depends on the application. If we want to know if the regular expression matches the entire string, as for example in file name matching, we check if we have simultaneously reached the end of the input, and if so, we abandon all further searches and return success; if not, we just continue searching. But if, for example, we want the longest match, we keep a high-water mark and continue until all searches have been exhausted.
