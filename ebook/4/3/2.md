# 4.3.2 自底向上表解析

The bottom-up tabular parsing algorithm fills all entries correctly, but requires more care than the top-down algorithm. Like CYK, it works most efficiently for grammars that are in Chomsky Normal Form, and we will assume our grammar to be so. And, like in CYK, we need to be careful with the order in which we compute the entries. Also, we will fill the three-dimensional “wedge” of Figure 4.21, the entries of which are Booleans (bits), rather than its two-dimensional front panel, the entries of which are lists of integers. The entry in the wedge which describes whether a terminal production of A with length k starts in position i is written Ti,A,k.

Bottom-up tabular parsing fills the whole recognition table by filling columns starting from the right end. To fill entry Ti,A,k, we find a rule of the form A → BC from the grammar, and we access Ti,B,1. If this entry is set, there is a segment at i of length 1 produced by B. So we access Ti+1,C,k−1, and if it is also set, there is a segment at i+1 of length k−1 produced by C. From this we conclude that the input segment at i of length k holds a terminal production of A and we set the entry Ti,A,k. If not, we try again with Ti,B,2 and Ti+2,C,k−2, etc., until Ti,B,k−1 and Ti+k−1,C,1, just as in the CYK algorithm.

We can stop at Ti+k−1,C,1, because grammars in CNF have no ε-rules, so Ti+k,C,0 does not exist. This means that the computation of the entry Ti,A,k involves entries Ti,B, j with j < k only. So if we compute all entries Ti,P, j before all entries Ti,Q,k for j < k and arbitrary P and Q, the values of all entries needed for the computation of Ti,A,k are guaranteed to be ready. This imposes a particular computation order on the algorithm:

The cost of computing one entry Ti,A,k is O(n|Pav|), where n is the length of the input and |Pav| the average number of production rules of a non-terminal. As we saw, this computation is repeated O(n|G|n) times, where |G| is proportional to the size of the grammar. So the time requirements of this parsing algorithm is O(n3|G||Pav|) or O(n3)×O(|G||Pav|).

Bottom-up tabular parsing is applied in a number of algorithms in Sections 12 and 15.7.

Nederhof and Satta [40] have written a tutorial on tabular parsing, applying it to a wide selection of non-deterministic parsing algorithms.
